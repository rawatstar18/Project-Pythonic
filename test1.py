#Arithmetic Operators and Data Types

#Adding two numbers

num1 = input("first number : ")
num2 = input("second number: ")

#When we use input(), it takes whatever we type and stores it as a string.
#So, the numbers stored in num1 and num2 are treated as text and not as mathematical numbers.
print ("sum of ", num1 ,'+', num2, 'is' , num1 + num2) 


#arithmetic operations

x = 5
y = 9

print (x + y) #addition

print (x-y) #subrataction

print (x/y) #division
